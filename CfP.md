# Title (60)

Data Inte`git`ry in the Pharmaceutical Industry

# Abstract (600)

Pharma is heavily regulated because _their_ APIs literally get under your skin (**a**ctive **p**harmaceutical **i**ngredients). Regulators increasingly focus on the integrity of electronic records relevant to an API's quality & safety (e.g. measurements, device configurations & training documentation). Those records are in need of version control!

Scouring publicly available guidance documents for data integrity requirements (e.g. from [EMA](http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/regulation/q_and_a/q_and_a_detail_000027.jsp#section16), [FDA](https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FDA-2016-D-1113-0002) & [MHRA](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/good-manufacturing-practice-data-integrity-definitions)), we'll see how the latter often map well to existing functionality of Git & Co. (e.g. "audit trail review" = pull requests). Moreover, we'll explore potential hurdles for Git in the pharmaceutical industry, and discuss solution ideas.
