# Title (60)

Pharmaceutical data inte`git`ry

# Abstract (600)

Pharma is heavily regulated because _their_ APIs really get under your skin (**a**ctive **p**harmaceutical **i**ngredients). An up-and-coming focus of the regulators ([EMA](http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/regulation/q_and_a/q_and_a_detail_000027.jsp#section16), [FDA](https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FDA-2016-D-1113-0002), [MHRA](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/good-manufacturing-practice-data-integrity-definitions),…) is the integrity of records relevant for the quality & safety of an API. Obviously, such records are increasingly captured digitally (measurements, device config, training docu,…), and thus require version control.

We'll learn about data integrity requirements from publicly available guidance documents. Strangely, some seem to exactly map to existing functionality of Git & Co. Finally, we'll explore problems for Git in pharma and solution ideas.
