# Title (60)

Data Inte`git`ry in the Pharmaceutical Industry

# Abstract (600)

Pharma is heavily regulated because _their_ APIs literally get under your skin (**a**ctive **p**harmaceutical **i**ngredients). Regulators increasingly focus on the integrity of electronic records relevant to an API's quality & safety (e.g. measurements, device configurations & training documentation). Those records are in need of version control!

Scouring publicly available guidance documents for data integrity requirements (e.g. from [EMA](http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/regulation/q_and_a/q_and_a_detail_000027.jsp#section16), [FDA](https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FDA-2016-D-1113-0002) & [MHRA](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/good-manufacturing-practice-data-integrity-definitions)), we'll see how the latter often map well to existing functionality of Git & Co. (e.g. "audit trail review" = pull requests). Moreover, we'll explore potential hurdles for Git in the pharmaceutical industry, and discuss solution ideas.

# Details (Explain theme & flow! Audience takeaways?)

The software industry adopted randomized, (placebo-)controlled trials (RCTs) from pharma and perfected them as A/B-tests. I think it's fair to say that  that these, together with version control catalysed collaborative software engineering and the app economy. Although the pharmaceutical industry has of course applied software in many ways, which similarly fundamental technology transfer is there? I believe that Git-based version control is _the_ candidate to be adopted and to perfect the audit trail. 

# Pitch (Why pertinent? Your involvement?)

In about two years of working in laboratory automation, I've never encountered the obvious candidate for version controlling digital files: Git, which is just a given in the FLOSS projects I volunteer for in my free time. The pharma industry seems to have established a parallel universe of "audit trailing" and "change controlling" their training documents, instrument configurations, data analysis methods, customer contracts, etc. Similarly, the software developers I asked about this didn't know that/how their dev tools and workflows already fulfil many pharma requirements. I want to start connecting these universes,  because whenever I read a guidance document on pharmaceutical data integrity, my head rings with recognition. Maybe regulators do know Git & Co.'s capabilities, but don't want out-right prescribe it to the pharma industry?
