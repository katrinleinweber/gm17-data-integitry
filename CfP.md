# Title (60)

Data Inte`git`ry for the Pharmaceutical Industry

# Abstract (600)

Pharma is strictly regulated because _their_ APIs literally get under your skin (**a**ctive **p**harmaceutical **i**ngredients). Regulatory agency are increasingly zeroing in on "data integrity", because it is necessary to prove an API's chemical purity, stability during storage, thus its safety for patients, and of course it's pharmaceutical effectiveness.

Scouring regulatory documents (for example by [EMA](http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/regulation/q_and_a/q_and_a_detail_000027.jsp#section16), [FDA](https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FDA-2016-D-1113-0002) & [MHRA](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/good-manufacturing-practice-data-integrity-definitions)), we'll find that data integrity requirements often map well to basic functionality of Git & Co. Pharma asks: "Audit trail?" We answer: "Erm, commit history!?!"

# Details (Explain theme & flow! Audience takeaways?)

The software industry adopted randomised, (placebo-)controlled trials (RCTs) from pharma and perfected them as A/B-tests. I think it's fair to say that  that these, together with version control catalysed collaborative software engineering and the app economy. Although the pharmaceutical industry has of course applied software in many ways, which similarly fundamental technology transfer is there? I believe that Git-based version control is _the_ candidate to be adopted in order to perfect the audit trail. 

# Pitch (Why pertinent? Your involvement?)

In about two years of working in laboratory automation, I've never encountered the obvious candidate for version controlling digital files: Git, which is just a given in the FLOSS projects I volunteer for in my free time. The pharma industry seems to have established a parallel universe of "audit trailing" and "change controlling" their training documents, instrument configurations, data analysis methods, customer contracts, etc. Similarly, the software developers I asked about this didn't know that/how their dev tools and workflows already fulfil many pharma requirements. I want to start connecting these universes,  because whenever I read a guidance document on pharmaceutical data integrity, my head rings with recognition. Maybe regulators do know Git & Co.'s capabilities, but don't want out-right prescribe it to the pharma industry?
