# Title

Pharmaceutical data inte`git`ry

# Abstract

The pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated, because _their_ APIs literally go under your skin (**a**ctive **p**harmaceutical **i**ngredients). An up-and-coming focus of the regulatory agencies ([EMA](http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/regulation/q_and_a/q_and_a_detail_000027.jsp#section16), [FDA](https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FDA-2016-D-1113-0002), [MHRA](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/good-manufacturing-practice-data-integrity-definitions)), etc.) is data integrity. "Completeness, consistency, and accuracy" of all records that are relevant for the quality and safety of an API. Obviously, more and more of these records (measurement data, device configuration files, training documentation, etc.) are captured digitally, and thus require version control.

We'll learn about Git-relevant requirements from publicly available guidance documents on pharmaceutical data integrity. Strangely, some can directly be mapped to existing functionality of Git and/or related tools. Finally, we'll explore problems for Git in pharma and solution ideas.
